# -The-Four-Friends-Puzzle
Problem Statement:
Four friends named Alex, Bob, Charlie, and Dave are standing in a line, not necessarily in that order. They each make a statement about their position:

Alex says, "I am not the first."
Bob says, "Charlie is not the last."
Charlie says, "Bob is not the first."
Dave says, "I am not the last."
Assuming that exactly one of the friends is lying and the rest are telling the truth, determine the order in which the four friends are standing.

Solution:
To solve this puzzle, analyze the statements and deduce the possible positions for each friend. Start by examining the statements individually and determine the positions that are consistent with each statement. Then, cross-reference the possibilities and find the unique arrangement that satisfies all the statements.

Here's one possible solution:

Bob
Charlie
Alex
Dave
